The shifter is designed to shift the input data to the left(c=0) or rotate the input data to the left(c=1) based on the control input, c.
Thus, for data input I3 I2 I1 I0, if c=0: output is I2 I1 I0 0 and c=1: output is I2 I1 I0 I3
The shift magnitude is determined by the decimal representation of the select lines.
The 2:1 MUX used for the shifter is designed structurally.
